I'm a undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine studying Computer Science! I am a part of UCI's Campus Honors Collegium and Information & Computer Science Honors Program. I'm interested in research in AI (in regards to its interdisciplinary applications).

I love coding, whether that be in my free time to create projects like [Boiling Bad](https://sn82978.github.io/BOILING-BAD/), or in my work at [Rose Mueller Laboratories](https://rosemuellerlabs.bio.uci.edu/), where I use AI in fields like evolutionary biology.
